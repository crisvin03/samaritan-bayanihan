# Training Video Script - Admin Verification Dashboard

## **Video 1: Dashboard Overview (5 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Welcome to the Samaritan Bayanihan User Verification Dashboard. This comprehensive system helps you review and approve user registrations with enhanced security measures.

Let's start with the dashboard overview. At the top, you'll see key metrics including total pending users and daily approvals. The main interface is organized into three tabs: Pending, Approved, and Rejected users.

Each user card displays essential information: name, email, phone number, registration date, IP address, and current verification status. The color-coded status badges help you quickly identify where each user is in the verification process.

The verification process has four levels: Email verification, Phone verification, Document upload, and Manual review. Users must complete each level before final approval."

## **Video 2: Review Process (8 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Now let's walk through the complete review process. When you click the 'Review' button on a user card, you'll see their detailed profile and uploaded documents.

First, verify the personal information is complete and consistent. Check the email format and phone number format. The system automatically validates Philippine phone numbers in the format +63 XXX XXX XXXX.

Next, examine the uploaded documents. Look for government-issued IDs like driver's licenses, passports, or national IDs. Ensure the documents are clear, readable, and appear authentic. Check that the information on the documents matches the user's registration details.

Pay special attention to the registration date and IP address. Multiple registrations from the same IP within a short timeframe may indicate suspicious activity."

## **Video 3: Decision Making (6 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Making the right approval or rejection decision is crucial for maintaining system security. Let's look at the approval criteria.

Approve users who have: complete personal information, valid government-issued ID, consistent information across all documents, age 18 or older, and no suspicious activity indicators.

Reject users who have: incomplete information, invalid or fake documents, inconsistent personal details, underage registration, or suspicious registration patterns.

When rejecting, always provide a clear reason. This helps users understand what they need to fix and improves the overall user experience. Common rejection reasons include: 'Documents are not clear', 'Incomplete personal information', 'Must be 18 years or older', or 'Invalid document type'."

## **Video 4: Security Features (7 minutes)**

### **Script**
"The verification system includes several security features to protect against fraudulent registrations. Let's explore these features.

The system tracks IP addresses and flags multiple registrations from the same source. It also monitors registration patterns and user behavior. Suspicious activity is automatically logged and flagged for review.

Document verification includes file type validation, size limits, and quality checks. The system only accepts JPG, PNG, and PDF files up to 10MB in size.

Rate limiting prevents automated registration attempts. Users are limited to 3 registration attempts per IP address per 24 hours. Verification attempts are also rate-limited to prevent abuse.

The system maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all verification activities, including who reviewed each user and when decisions were made."

## **Video 5: Common Scenarios (10 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Let's work through some common scenarios you'll encounter in the verification process.

Scenario 1: A user uploads only one document when two are required. In this case, reject the user with the reason 'Please upload all required documents' and they'll be notified to complete their submission.

Scenario 2: Documents are blurry or unreadable. Reject with 'Documents are not clear. Please upload high-quality images' and provide specific instructions for better photos.

Scenario 3: Multiple registrations from the same IP address. Review each registration individually. If they appear to be legitimate family members with different names and information, approve them. If they're obvious duplicates, reject the extras.

Scenario 4: A user is under 18 years old. Reject with 'Must be 18 years or older to register' and suggest they register when they reach the required age.

Scenario 5: Suspicious email addresses like temporary or fake domains. Reject with 'Please provide a valid email address' and ask for a legitimate email."

## **Video 6: Advanced Features (5 minutes)**

### **Script**
"The verification dashboard includes several advanced features to improve your efficiency and effectiveness.

Use the search function to quickly find specific users by name or email address. Filter users by verification status, registration date, or barangay to focus on specific groups.

Bulk operations allow you to select multiple users for approval or rejection, saving time when processing similar cases. Export functionality lets you download user data for reporting and analysis.

The analytics section provides insights into verification patterns, approval rates, and common rejection reasons. Use this data to improve the verification process and identify areas for training.

Reports can be generated for specific time periods, showing registration trends, approval statistics, and geographic distribution of users."

## **Video 7: Best Practices (8 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Following best practices ensures consistent and fair verification decisions while maintaining security standards.

Always review all available information before making a decision. Don't rush through the verification process, as mistakes can compromise system security.

Be consistent in your decision-making. Use the same criteria for all users and document your reasoning for complex cases. This helps maintain fairness and provides a clear audit trail.

Communicate clearly with users through rejection reasons. Provide specific, actionable feedback that helps them understand what they need to fix.

Stay updated on security threats and verification techniques. Attend regular training sessions and review updated guidelines to maintain your expertise.

When in doubt, escalate to a supervisor or security team member. It's better to be cautious than to approve a potentially fraudulent account."

## **Video 8: Troubleshooting (6 minutes)**

### **Script**
"Let's address common issues you might encounter while using the verification dashboard.

If the dashboard loads slowly, check your internet connection and try refreshing the page. Large numbers of pending users can sometimes cause performance issues.

If documents don't display properly, ensure you have the latest version of your web browser and that JavaScript is enabled. Some document types may require specific browser plugins.

If you can't find a specific user, try using different search terms or check if they might be in a different status category. The search function is case-sensitive, so try different capitalizations.

If you make an incorrect decision, contact your supervisor immediately. Some decisions can be reversed, but it's important to act quickly to minimize impact on users.

For technical issues with the system, contact the IT support team with specific details about the problem, including error messages and steps to reproduce the issue."

## **Video 9: Assessment and Certification (4 minutes)**

### **Script**
"After completing the training videos, you'll need to pass an assessment to become certified to use the verification dashboard.

The assessment includes multiple-choice questions about verification procedures, security protocols, and decision-making criteria. You'll also complete a practical exercise where you review sample user registrations and make appropriate decisions.

To pass the assessment, you must score at least 80% on the knowledge check and successfully complete the practical exercise. The assessment is designed to ensure you understand the verification process and can make appropriate decisions.

Upon successful completion, you'll receive a certification that's valid for one year. Annual recertification is required to maintain your access to the verification dashboard and stay updated on any process changes.

Remember, your role in user verification is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the Bayanihan community. Take your time, follow the procedures, and don't hesitate to ask questions when you're unsure."
